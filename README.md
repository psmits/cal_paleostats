Teaching material from my sections of the 2018 UCBerkeley Analytical Paleobiology course.

- Introduction to statistical inference and Bayesian data analysis
- Introduction to advanced regression

Material is heavily based on [**Statistical Rethinking** by Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/), supplmented with material from [**Bayesian Data Analysis 3** by Gelman et al.](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/), and [**Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models** by Gelman and Hill](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/data-analysis-using-regression-and-multilevelhierarchical-models/32A29531C7FD730C3A68951A17C9D983). 

Additionally, my code is heavily cribbed from [Solomon Kurz's **brms** rewrite of **Statistical Rethinking**](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/1850/access).

At any point some sentences and examples are copied verbatim or nearly so; I make no claim to their ownership and they are only used here for example and learning purposes.

These lessons require the following r packages:

- tidyverse
- brms
- tidybayes
- modelr
