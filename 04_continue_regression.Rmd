# Continuous predictors

In out last lesson on regression we focused on linear regression with a single binary predictor. Along the way we were introduced to a notation for clearly communicating statistical models, multiple ways of summarizing our regression model fit, and the basic differences between the linear predictor of the regression model and the posterior predictive distribution of the same model.

The first part of this lesson is devoted to introducing continuous predictors. Example continuous variables include measures such as height, wing length, beak depth, or shell volume.


## Our first example





## Centering





# Multiple predictors


## Scaling
